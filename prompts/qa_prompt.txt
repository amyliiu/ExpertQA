Question: I work in the field of music. What is a madrigal?
Answer: A madrigal is a form of secular vocal music most typical of the Renaissance and early Baroque periods [1]. The polyphonic madrigal is unaccompanied, whilst the metre of the madrigal varies between two or three tercets, followed by one or two couplets [2]. Unlike the verse-repeating strophic forms sung to the same music,[3] most madrigals are through-composed, featuring different music for each stanza of lyrics [4].
